# RIS Vetted Applications

This page contains basic information and user-friendly guides to running RIS-vetted
application containers on compute. This is `not` an inclusive list of usable applications, by
any means, and is intended solely as a starting point for new users.

This page does not include application containers where the user does not want,
or is forbidden, to put code into a public registry.

> [!WARNING]
> The application containers listed on this page have been vetted to start a\
> shell in an interactive job at the time of testing and were confirmed\
> working at the time they were tested. The level of security with\
> non-RIS-hosted images is not guaranteed and has not been tested.\\
> As such, we recommend to use RIS-hosted Docker images when possible. Please\
> visit *this page* for a list of RIS supported Docker images.

> [!NOTE]
> To successfully run `bsub` commands on this page, you must already be logged into the Compute Service:\
> `> ssh ${compute_username}@compute1-client-1.ris.wustl.edu`\
> If you are not connected to a a Medical School network (WUSM-secure, MSVPN),\
> or the Danforth VPN, you will need to perform port forwarding before\
> accessing a GUI (i.e. accessing a Jupyter notebook or RStudio session).\

  and implemented a graph FM index (GFM), an original approach and its first implementation to the best of our knowledge. In addition
  to using one global GFM index that represents a population of human genomes, HISAT2 uses a large set of small GFM indexes that collectively
  cover the whole genome (each index representing a genomic region of 56 Kbp, with 55,000 indexes needed to cover the human population).
  These small indexes (called local indexes), combined with several alignment strategies, enable rapid and accurate alignment of sequencing
  reads. This new indexing scheme is called a Hierarchical Graph FM index (HGFM)." - Source: https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/hisat2/index.shtml

  * When you are finished with your server, use Ctrl+C to stop this server (twice to skip confirmation) and “exit” the interactive shell.

* If you encounter an error stating your shell has not been properly configured,
  please see this :ref:`section on initializing your shell to use conda <ris-vetted-compute-anaconda-error>`.

* If you encounter an error during startup, specifically with applications such as fluxbox, x11vnc, or xterm, in addition to seeing something like "(exited status 1; not expected)" in your terminal, you will need to ssh into the same host again.
  Assuming you are currently on `compute1-client-1.ris.wustl.edu`, please ssh again to `compute1-client-1.ris.wustl.edu` and try to run your job again.
  Meaning, SSH from your local machine to compute1 and then from compute1 again to compute1. For example: localhost --> compute1-client-1 --> compute1-client-1
  These issues appear to exist due to incompatible local terminal configuration, MobaXTerm for Windows and Terminal for Mac, being carried forward and applied on the compute1 system.

  * Mac Alternative: please install iTerm2, ssh back into compute1 via iTerm2, and submit your job again as normal.

    * Installation can be performed through homebrew, if already installed, or through direct download via the following link

      Direct Download: https://iterm2.com/downloads.html

      .. code ::

          # Install via homebrew
          brew install --cask iterm2

      iTerm2 Documentation: https://iterm2.com/documentation.html

  * Windows Alternative: please install Windows Terminal from the Microsoft Store and enable the OpenSSH client under "Optional Features"

    OpenSSH Client: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse?tabs=gui#install-openssh-for-windows

* If the expected python/conda environment is not loaded by Jupyter and unable to be selected through the GUI's "kernel" option atop the window, ipykernel should be installed.
  This process is performed by simply installing `ipykernel` within a given python/conda environment, followed by registering that environment with the newly installed kernel (ipykernel).
  Once completed, restart the running Jupyter container. The configured python environment should now be accessible through the aforementioned "kernel" option, atop the Jupyter Notebooks web GUI. (This assumes previous env setup was properly completed.)

  .. code ::

    # Activate your python environment
    source activate <my-python-environment>
    # Install necessary package
    python3 -m pip install ipykernel
    # Assign a name to be seen in the Jupyter Notebooks "kernels" option drop down

.. _`ris-jupyter-password`:

Setting Up A Jupyter Notebook Password
######################################

  It is recommended to password-protect your Jupyter sessions. This can be done
  after submitting a RAPIDS interactive job. After your interactive job has
  landed, please follow the instructions below.

1. Start an iPython session.

  .. code::

    > ipython

2. Enter in the following commands at the iPython prompt, each in their own
   line.

  .. code::

    In [1]: from notebook.auth import passwd
    In [2]: passwd()

3. You will be prompted to enter and verify a password. The result will be a
   string of characters.

  .. code::

    Out[2]: 'argon2:$argon2id$v=19$m=10241,t=10,p=8$+ASmr7ZxR7Glc8ZVu+fn6g$Ehusp4AdgQjv/zq5AWFy0g'

4. Copy the string of characters and exit out of iPython and RAPIDS interactive
   job.

.. code::

    In [3]: quit
    > exit

5. Open the Jupyter configuration file with ``Vim``.

.. note::

  For help on using Vim, please see this `resource <https://vimhelp.org/>`_.

.. code::

    > vim ~/.jupyter/jupyter_notebook_config.py

6. Add the copied string of characters to the ``c.NotebookApp.password``
   variable. The file should look like the example below (replacing the string
   after ``u`` with the string you copied):

.. code::

    c.NotebookApp.password = u'argon2:$argon2id$v=19$m=10241,t=10,p=8$+ASmr7ZxR7Glc8ZVu+fn6g$Ehusp4AdgQjv/zq5AWFy0g'

7. Save the file and exit out of ``Vim``.
8. From now on, when you submit a job that uses Jupyter notebook, you will be
   prompted to enter your password.
9. If you ever forget the password, delete the configuration file and start
   over.

.. code::

    > rm ~/.jupyter/jupyter_notebook_config.py

.. _`ris-vetted-compute-port-selection`:

.. admonition:: Port Selection

  Some applications require access to a port inside the running Docker container
  to run an application. Two examples would be Jupyter and RStudio, which use
  ports 8888 and 8787 respectively. When submitting a job, a port is exposed and
  forwarded to a port inside the Docker container using the
  ``LSF_DOCKER_PORTS`` environment variable. Please see our
  :ref:`documentation<lsf-docker-ports-detail>` for more information on using
  ``LSF_DOCKER_PORTS``.

  The Jupyter :ref:`example job submissions <ris-vetted-app-containers-jupyter>`
  expose port 8888 to access the running Jupyter Docker container while the
  RStudio example job submissions expose port 8000. If you choose to use a
  different port, you will also need to update the job submission command. This
  is true for all jobs requiring access to a port.

  For example, if an application is running on port 8999, and you would like to
  expose port 8001 to access the application running in the Docker container on
  port 8999, you would need to update the job submission command as follows:

  Modify ``LSF_DOCKER_PORTS``:

  .. code::

    export LSF_DOCKER_PORTS="8001:8999"

  Modify the LSF port resource request:

  .. code::

    -R "select[port8001=1]"

  Notice that only the first port in ``LSF_DOCKER_PORTS`` is changed since port
  8999 is the port defined by the Docker image maintainer to run the application
  with. Any port between 8000-8999 can be exposed.

  If the application requires access via a web browser, the port in the URL will
  also need to be changed. As an example, to access a Jupyter session using port
  8001, the URL would need to be changed to:

    http://compute1-exec-nn.ris.wustl.edu:8001/?token=<48-character token>
